 * This class implements the Mountain Car environment.
 * In this problem a car is placed on a valley between two hills
 * and has to reach the top of one of them.
 * Unfortunately, it is not able to do so by only accelerating and,
 * therefore, it has to accelerate in the opposite direction to use
 * the slope of the other hill to acquire inertia that may allow it
 * to reach the goal.
