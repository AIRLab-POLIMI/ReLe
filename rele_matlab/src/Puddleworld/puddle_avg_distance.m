avg_J = (-1.7103e+003 - sum(sum(map))) / 399
% 399 because the initial state cannot be the goal position or a cell on 
% the border of the grid
% -sum(sum(map)) because the reward is given only for doing an action and
% this means that at the initial state no penalty is given

mapdist = rot90(map);

% NB: to have such average we need to uniformly sample all possible initial
% states, that are 20x20 = 400. This means that, if we don't want to
% 'cheat' (i.e. use every different initial state for each episode during the
% learning), we need a lot of samples to have a uniform sampling of all the
% initial states.
